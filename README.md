**Problems that I faced in this challenge**

This challenge is very easy for me; we can do it with Flex-Box and Postions, but making a responsive webpage is a real challenge. This is the first time I used media queries, and I'm stuck on the media queries part because I never tried it in a past challenge. So, in this challenge, I used media queries. It's not as good as I expected.
